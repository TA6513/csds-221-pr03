# Remake of the famous chrome Dino Game

Sfx and sprites are ripped from the game
Game logic and implementation are original

Space to jump, down arrow to duck, pause and reset buttons included

Cactus generation is semi random, places a cactus if it's been too long without one,
tries to avoid placing them too close together but not perfect.

Made to run at 60fps, however on github pages this of course isn't the case
You are welcome to download the files to get full performance.
