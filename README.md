Remake of the famous chrome Dino Game

Sounds and sprites are ripped from the game
Game logic and implementation are original

Space to jump, down arrow to duck, pause and reset buttons included

Cactus generation is mostly random. The game tries not to put cacti too
close together but it's not guaranteed to be perfect
