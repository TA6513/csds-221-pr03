# Remake of the famous chrome Dino Game

SFX and sprites are ripped from the game
Game logic and implementation are original

## Features

Space or up arrow to jump, down arrow to duck
After death, space and up arrow restart, or you can click the restart button

Accurate SFX and scoring
Saves high scores for the session
Gradual speed increase
Big and small cacti

Cactus generation is semi random, places a cactus if it's been too long without one,
tries to avoid placing them too close together but not perfect

Made to run at 60fps, however on github pages this of course isn't the case
You are welcome to download the files to get full performance
Essentially: game speed is tied to network/computer speed, so results may vary
